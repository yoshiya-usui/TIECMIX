Those scripts allows one to calulate the electrical conductivity for transversely isotropic rocks with interconnected cracks/tube based on the theory of Usui (2024)

_Yoshiya Usui, 2024, Electrical conductivity model for transversely isotropic rocks with interconnected cracks, Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors, https://doi-org.utokyo.idm.oclc.org/10.1016/j.pepi.2024.107226_

CrackZ.py gives the electrical conductivity in the z-directtion (sigma_z) for transversely isotropic rocks with interconnected cracks.

CrackX.py gives the electrical conductivity in the x-directtion (sigma_x) for transversely isotropic rocks with interconnected cracks.

Calc_kappa.py calculates the hyperparameter kappa of the Watson distribution from the ratio sigma_x/sigma_z (variable "ans" in the script).

TubeZ.py gives the electrical conductivity in the z-directtion (sigma_z) for transversely isotropic rocks with interconnected tubes.

TubeX.py gives the electrical conductivity in the x-directtion (sigma_x) for transversely isotropic rocks with interconnected tubes.
